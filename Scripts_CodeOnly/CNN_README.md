- Below notes are sometimes verbatim - i have added my own inputs also 
- Feature extraction -->> Conv Layer >> Conv Filter | Conv Kernels which will build further Feature Maps  
- Pooling Layers -->> Reduce Dimensionality , this compression enhances specific aspects of these Feature Maps
- RELU - Rectified Linear Units - Non Linear Activation functions 
- Overfitting - Predictions on Training data are very good 
- DropOut and BatchNormalization Layers - are used to prevent Overfitting
- Fully Connected Layers -- used as final stage layers for Flattening and Predictions
- CNN's have a Stacked Layer Acrhitecture - Layers are stacked on after another . Output from the previous layers is mostly the Input to the next layers 
- CNN will have CONV LAyers and POOLING layers usually as alternating layers
- One CONV Layer will have Multiple Filters | Kernels - the output of these Filters or Kernels is a Feature MAP 
- The RAW IMAGE is divided into PATCHES of PIXELS - 1 patch could be a 3X3 Pixel Patch (9 PIXELS in Area - 3 LEN and 3 WIDTH)
- All the FILTERS are passed over each PATCH of the IMAGE and for each FILTER passing on Each Patch we have a RESULT which is a DOT PRODUCT
- Thus we will obtain FEATURE MAPS same count as we have FILTERS 
- TODO - convolution stride 
- TODO - SOURCE >> https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.1556.pdf The image is passed through a stack of convolutional (conv.) layers, where we use filters with a very small receptive field: 3 Ã— 3 (which is the smallest size to capture the notion of left/right, up/down, center) 
- Next layer is the POOLING LAYER - this will Down Sample the  FEATURE MAPS
